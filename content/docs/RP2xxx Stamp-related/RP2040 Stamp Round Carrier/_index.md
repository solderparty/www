The Round Carrier was created as a reference design for the RP2040 Stamp, but don't let the name fool you, it is also compatible with the RP2350 Stamp, as well as a full-fledged round RP2xxx dev board.

The Carrier comes with a combo 3-in-1 SMD/TH/FlexyPin Stamp footprint, you can solder the Stamp directly to the Carrier, use 2mm pin headers + sockets to be able to plug it in and out, or use [FlexyPins](/docs/flexypin) to pop the Stamp in and out of the Carrier would soldering the Stamp. This way the Carrier also acts as a great Stamp flashing and testing jig.

The board can be powered from the LiPo, or USB Type-C connector.

By using the RP2040 Stamp Carrier, you get everything that comes with the Stamp itself, plus:

- **A ring of 16 Neopixels**
- **Combo 3-in-1 Stamp footprint (SMD/TH/FlexyPin)**
- **Sewing (conductive thread) and alligator clip-friendly pads**
- An on/off switch
- 3.7/4.2V LiPo connector
- USR LED
- Power (3.3V) LED
- Two user buttons
- USB Type-C connector

If you have the LiPo and USB Type-C connected, the battery will begin charging.
