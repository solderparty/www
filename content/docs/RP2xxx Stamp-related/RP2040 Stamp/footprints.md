We have prepared a collection of RP2040 Stamp symbols, footprints, and 3D models for various EE CAD programs to make it easy for you to use the board in your designs. You can find them in [this github repository](https://github.com/solderparty/rp2xxx_stamp_footprints).

Currently we have footprints and symbols for KiCad, EagleCAD, and EasyEDA. If you have made footprints and/or symbols for other EE CAD programs and would like to share them with others, you can send a pull request to the repo linked above.

All our footprints and symbols are released as public domain.
