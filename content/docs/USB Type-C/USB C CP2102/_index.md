A USB-to-UART bridge, now in your USB Type-C port! Works out-of-the-box on most Linux flavours, for other drivers, see [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

The chip is USB 2.0 full-speed compatible and can achieve data transfer rates up to 1 Mbaud.

In addition to breaking out the most common RX/TX/RTS/CTS pins, the board also breaks out almost all the other pins, see schematic in the Downloads section for details. The signal pins are 5V tolerant - they should work with both 3.3V and 5V.

The board also features RX and TX LEDs to help you debug issues, they will light up when data is transferred.

For more details see the datasheet in the Downloads section or the [Serial Communications Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an197.pdf) from Silicon Labs.
