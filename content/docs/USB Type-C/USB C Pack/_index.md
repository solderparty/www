If you ever wanted to add a USB Type-C Plug to your design, you probably realized that it's hard to find one that's easy to solder, can be routed on 2-layer PCBs, and doesn't put constraints on your PCB thickness. We're happy to report this connector checks all these boxes! You've probably seen this connector used in [our](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/serpente-a-tiny-circuitpython-prototyping-board/) [other](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/usb-type-c-plug-breakout-usb-20-only/) [products](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/usb-type-c-plug-breakout-usb-30-only/).

Because there's only so many pins you can fit in one row, the connector does not break out all the USB Type-C pins, but there's enough for most DIY uses. You get the USB 2.0 data pins (D+ and D-), the CC and VCONN pins, as well as two SuperSpeed differential pairs (RX2+/- and TX2+/-). The SBU pins are not available.

As per the USB Type-C specification, the plug has only one pair of D+/D- pins; it's up to the Receptacle to connect them together or use a mux for more advanced scenarios. Similar with CC and VCONN pins.

The connectors are delivered on a 24mm tape.
