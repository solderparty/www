This little board makes it easy to use [I2C PMOD](https://blog.digilentinc.com/new-i2c-standard-for-pmods/) boards with the [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and [Stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt) ecosystems of boards.

The adapter has two Qwiic/Stemma QT connectors. You can use it as a part of a daisy-chain: connect one of the connectors to the Host or a different Peripheral board, and the other connector to another Peripheral board to continue the chain. You can use either connector for either purpose; there is no direction of signals.

The easiest way to mount it is to use the extra-long headers supplied with the Adapter. Just make sure to align the board properly.
