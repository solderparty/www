This Flux project transforms an RP2040 Stamp into a small handheld console with a **1.3" 128x64 OLED**, D-pad + A and B buttons, **RGB LED**, a **Qwiic** connector, a power switch, and a **speaker**.

As the console is powered by the Stamp, you can run **CircuitPython** on it, as well as **Arduino**, including experimental support for the **Arduboy2** library.


To make it truly portable, you will need a battery. This product does not ship with one, you can use any 3.7V/4.2V LiPo that is around or smaller than 40x30 mm. We recommend the [500mAh LiPo from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/lipo-battery-pack?variant=20429082055).

You can find a 3D-printable model for the case on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/279210-rp2040-stamp-handheld-console-case). You will also need four M2x4 screws and four M2 threaded inserts. 

The game visible in the photos is the game ["Catacombs of the damned!"](https://github.com/jhhoward/Arduboy3D).
