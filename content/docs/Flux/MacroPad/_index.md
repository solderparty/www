Just add switches and key caps and you have a 3x4 MacroPad powered by the RP2040 Stamp, each key footprint includes a individually addressable **NeoPixel**, the board also comes with a **1.3" 128x64 OLED**, **three function buttons**, and extra GPIOs on an **optional header**.

The board features a 3-in-1 combo RP2040 Stamp footprint, meaning you can solder the Stamp directly using the SMD pads, use 2mm pin headers, or using our FlexyPins!

You can program it using Arduino or CircuitPython.
