A minimalistic 4x4 NeoPixel matrix controlled by an RP2040 Stamp. The board contains a **three-way switch**, a **Qwiic** connector, a **LiPo** connector, USB Type-C socket, and a **power switch**.

As the Photo Light is powered by the Stamp, you can run **CircuitPython** on it, as well as **Arduino**.

Make sure you use a 3.7V/4.2V LiPo with the Photo Light.

The board contains four M2.5 mounting holes, which could be used to attach a diffuser or a case to hold the battery.
