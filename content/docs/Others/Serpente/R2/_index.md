The Serpente boards are low-cost development boards designed to be used with Adafruit's CircuitPython. For more information and learning material regarding CircuitPython, please follow the [Welcome to CircuitPython!](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview) article from Adafruit.

All three boards are virtually the same, except for the USB connector. The standard Serpente board contains a female USB Type-C connector, the Serpente Plug C contains a male USB Type-C connector, and the Serpente Plug uses the board itself as a Type-A USB plug.

If you are familiar with the Digispark boards, you may notice some similarities. This fact is of course not incidental, the Serpente boards are inspired by the Digispark, both in form-factor as well as use-cases. The Serpente boards are meant to be used as quick and dirty, yet flexible, prototyping tools.

## Technical details

Here are some of the technical details regarding the boards:

- ATSAMD21E18A 32-bit Cortex-M0+ running at 48MHz
- 256KB flash and 32KB RAM
- 4MB Flash for storing files and CircuitPython code
- 6 highly customizable GPIOs
- 250mA LDO
- 3.3V logic and power
- Powered either from USB or external source
- User-controlled RGB LED
- Mounting holes on the Serpente female Type-C board
- Castellated edges so the boards can be used as modules easily
